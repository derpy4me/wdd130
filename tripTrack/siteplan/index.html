            <p>
              <span class="displayFont">Trip Track</span> is for managing of
              vehicle expenses to help ensure that customers are aware of the
              vehicle costs. This can be helpful with the ever fluctuating costs
              of gas and oil. Also, can help to save for future maintenance
              giving a helpful estimate from previous checkups.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="emphasis">Maintenance</p>
            <p>
              A vehicle can go further and provide a smoother experience when it
              is properly maintained. Most people don't know, or might not even
              care what mainteance of vehilce requires, prefering to drop it off
              at a mechanic demanding a fix. This can incur higher costs.
              Whether done yourself or by someone else it's easier to have
              little checkups and fixes at steady intervals than spending a
              large chunk of money when something breaks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="emphasis">Remind</p>
            <p>
              A vehicle has many small and large moving parts. All of these
              require checkups, and sometimes need to be replaced after a while.
              It can be difficult without being familiar with a vehicle to keep
              track of the bells and whistles involved. Reminding users that
              their vehicle should have a once over can help to reduce the
              chance of a large pile of cash disappearing into a mechanics
              pocket in the future.
